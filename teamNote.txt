Awesome work peoples, very impressive work!

As a thank you, when we get the first batch of hardware assembled (in the near future), 
I will order some extra robots to give to everyone on our team (Please DM me know your contact info so I don't have to creep y'all).

Also as an aside, if you have any suggestions for hardware improvements, I would love to hear your ideas!

And don't forget about the Wednesday night meetups at MakerSpace North, I offer free laser cutting and CNC to the meetup members.

Thanks!
Michael
